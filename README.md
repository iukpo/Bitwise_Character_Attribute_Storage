# Bitwise Character Attribute Storage

This is a small Unity application adapted from Penny De Byl's *A Beginner's Guide to Essential Mathematics, Data Structures and Algorithms used in Game Programming applied in Unity* course.

The purpose of this application is to teach the developer how to efficiently store video game character attributes within primitives. Storing attributes within primitives reduces the amount of memory needed to keep track of a character state.

In this application, the character has five simple attributes: the ability to fly, to be super smart or charismatic (or both!), to have magical abilities, and to be able to turn invisible. Each attribute is turned on by touching the appropriate door. For example, if you touched the door that had "Magic" written on it, you would toggle the magic powers attribute.

Each attribute can be turned off by walking through the "anti" door that has an X marked over that attribute.

Walking through the door marked with Superman's logo activates all powers, but what does the door across from it do? Hmm...

## *Charta pardonationis se defendendo*

For my fellow comic book fans: The character does not have the ability to become the world famous Superman, just gain all the super powers represented by each door. Let's not debate what the actual Superman (or any of the other Supermen, such as the Eradicator, Hank Henshaw, etc.) character can do!
